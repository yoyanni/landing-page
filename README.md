# Landing Page Project from The Odin Project

This is to test my knowledge and see how much i have retained the flexbox information.

## Notes

### Should I use a list or divs in the nav element?

The reason I thought about this was due to the li element having 7 extra pixels compared to the a element which were in them.

With some research, it seems like there isn't a real benefit. It use to be used back in the day before HTML5 due to no nav element.

_So in conclusion, at least for now,_ I wont be using a list in the nav.

**P.S.** The 7 extra pixels were due to the larger font logo. Still easier though to align-items with divs instead of list.

### How I thought about the alignment of content.

When I mean alignment, I mean how the Header logo aligns with the below awesome content in the start and also how it ends again aligned.

Initially I thought about using flex-box and justify content but when resizing the window that would not always align due different grouping of elements.

_My solution at the moment_ is percentage margin values.
